\section{ACADEMIC PROJECTS}

{\customcvproject{AP Drive}{September 2018 - January 2019}
  {\begin{itemize}
    \item A File Hosting Service inspired by Drop Box using C++
    \item Allows multi-user synchronization , file sharing as group and individual , file management,upload and download and storage management for root and admin users. All features are accessible both local and through the net. 
    \item this project was implemented by Object Oriented and multi-file methodology
    \item phase1: Program works similar to linux file system. Implemented locally and without graphical features.
    \item phase2: User interface implementation based on Client-Server distributed model by using web tools.
  \end{itemize}
  }
}

{\customcvproject{Smart House}{Jun 2018 â€“ August 2018}
{\begin{itemize}
  \item IOT based project tested on a wooden home prototype using mostly python and java
  \item By use of a raspberry pi as central gateway of sensor communications , home daily activities such as opening door, powering lights and watering flowers was done automated.
  \item then raspberry interacted through HTTPS and MQTT protocols with a simple android app. as raspberry had massive computation capacity , vital warnings could activate edge computing services such as Fire extinguisher.
